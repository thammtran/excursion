<strong>Objective:</strong> 

In this project, you’ll create a web page which advertises a product called <em>“Excursion.”</em> You’ll use your growing toolset including HTML, CSS, Command Line Interface, Git, and GitHub. You’ll be proud of yourself when it all comes together!

The web page we’ll build advertises a mobile app which helps users record and share their experiences, so we’ll use video and landscape imagery to set the scene. A landing page is a vital tool in marketing a product these days, and the goal will be to entice potential customers into using the product.
